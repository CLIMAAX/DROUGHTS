This is particularly relevant for semi-arid regions which are increasingly prone to  prolonged drought periods making artificial irrigation unfeasible, as well as historically wet regions that have not yet implemented artificial irrigation at large-scale but might experience a significant decline in precipitation rates with future climate change.

    "The starting point of the hazard assessment is the calculation of the soil standard evapotranspiration (ET0) using the Penman-Monteith equation described by FAO [(Allen et al., 1998)](https://www.fao.org/3/x0490e/x0490e00.htm). The Penman-Monteith equation allows to calculate the reference evapotranspiration demand (i.e., how much water does a standard plant requires to live) combining thermal radiation and wind data. ET0 does not hold any plant-specific information, but represents the climate-driven evapotranspiration demand for a reference crop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard evapotranspiration is then combined with a series of crop-specific information to derive the crop standard evapotranspiration (ETc). The crop-specific parameters used to calculate ETc vary depending on the [thermal climate zone](https://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/2b0a758c-d40d-5706-a80d-32ebd864a57a) considered. Thus, ETc represents the maximum evapotranspiration potential of each crop for a given thermal climate zone. From ETc, it is possible to derive the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) using precipitation data to estimate the local water availability for the plant. Hence, ETa represents a fraction of ETc. Using the equations from the FAO I&D 33 paper [(Doorenbos et al., 1979)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259842050_FAO_Irrigation_and_Drainage_Paper_33), is then possible to relate the ratio between the rainfed and the maximum evapotranspiration potential to the crop yield loss (%) in rainfed-only conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The hazard assessment can currently be performed for the 14 crops parameterised in the [crop table](crop_table.ipynb), but this can be modfied to add any crop the user might be interested in. The assessment is performed using climate data averaged inter-annually to show the impact of precipitation scarcity on yield for an average growing season in the selected period. "

   "source": [
    "One limitation of this approach to calculate yield losses derive from the paramterization of the crop-specific indicators. Indeed, the thermal climate zone division is rather coarse and does not allow to accurately capture all sub-regional climate characteristics. As a consequence, the definition of the season start and end days, as well as the length of the growing period might not accurately represent the real conditions in all studied regions. However, the user can overcome these limitations by manually edit the [crop table](crop_table.csv) and insert the parameters that best represent the local conditions they want to assess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation derives from the use of the Doorenbos et al., (1979) equation to relate water scarcity to yield losses. On one hand, this approach has been widely used in the literature as it is extremely straight-forward but still offers a good estimate of yield reductions. On the other, more sophisticated approaches have now been developed to get more accurate quantification of aridity-related yield losses taking into account additional processes and parameters [(Steduto et al., 2012)](https://www.fao.org/3/i2800e/i2800e00.htm). For the purpose of this workflow, the choice of the Doorenbos method seemed the most approapriate due to its long-standing solidity and computational efficiency. The user is invited to cross-check the results with those produced by more sophisticated softwares like [CropWat](https://www.fao.org/3/i2800e/i2800e.pdf) to assess the robustness of the workflow."

    "The maps show the potential yield loss from irrigation deficit in the studied region for the selected crops (here maize and wheat), emission scenario (here RCP2.6) and period (here 2046-2050). Yield loss is expressed as the percentage reduction in yield if crops are grown under rainfed only conditions rather than fully irrigated. \n",

    "These maps can be used by demonstrators to understand in which areas of their region cropland will potentially experience the highest hydro-climatic stress. This allows them to target adaptation efforts in the most affected areas favouring a cost-effective use of resources. At the same time, the map provides a snap-shot of a potential future growing season that can be used to guide cropland expansion towards areas less affected by water stress.\n"
