    "**Probabilistic assessment of flood damage** is calculated for different return periods (i.e. 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250 and 500 years). In this way, damage-probability curves can be obtained at the grid cell by interpolating the damage estimates between the different recurrence intervals considered. The expected annual damages at a given grid cell due to river flooding are thus the integral of the damage-probability curve. Flood protection can be included in the expected annual damages estimation by truncating the damage-probability curves at the corresponding protection level (e.g. design flood with return period of 100 years). The integral of the remaining part after truncation quantifies the expected annual damages and expected annual population affected caused by river flooding considering flood protection up to the design flood.  \n",
