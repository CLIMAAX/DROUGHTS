## How to run

See our [how to use risk workflows](https://handbook.climaax.eu/notebooks/workflows_how_to.html) page in the Handbook for more information.

### Launch a binder session

Binder sessions are not persistent and may not provide the necessary computing resources to run all workflow steps.
